Multiple Tables with REBU

Letâ€™s practice what we learned about joins by combining rows from different tables.

Suppose you are a data analyst at REBU, a ridesharing platform. For a project, you were given three tables:

    trips - trips information
    riders - users data
    cars - autonomous cars

Have fun!
