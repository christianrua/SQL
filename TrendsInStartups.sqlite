/*Trends in Startups

Howdy! It’s your first day as a TechCrunch reporter. Your first task is to write an article on the rising trends in the startup world.

To get you started with your research, your boss emailed you a project.sqlite file that contains a table called startups. It is a portfolio of some of the biggest names in the industry.

Write queries with aggregate functions to retrieve some interesting insights about these companies.

What are you waiting for? Let’s get started!

quest1
Getting started, take a look at the startups table:

SELECT *
FROM startups;

How many columns are there?

quest2
Calculate the total number of companies in the table.

quest3
We want to know the total value of all companies in this table.

Calculate this by getting the SUM() of the valuation column.

quest4
What is the highest amount raised by a startup?

Return the maximum amount of money raised.

quest5
Edit the query so that it returns the maximum amount of money raised, during ‘Seed’ stage.

quest6
In what year was the oldest company on the list founded?

quest7
Return the average valuation.

quest8
Return the average valuation, in each category.

quest9
Return the average valuation, in each category.

Round the averages to two decimal places.

quest10
Return the average valuation, in each category.

Round the averages to two decimal places.

Lastly, order the list from highest averages to lowest.

quest11
First, return the name of each category with the total number of companies that belong to it.

quest12
Next, filter the result to only include categories that have more than three companies in them.

What are the most competitive markets?

quest13
What is the average size of a startup in each location?

quest14
What is the average size of a startup in each location, with average sizes above 500?
